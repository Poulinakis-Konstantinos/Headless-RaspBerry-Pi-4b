Problem:  When I connect with VNC viewer, a black windows appears with written: "cannot currently show the desktop". 

Solution: This is usually because of a resolution mismatch between VNC server ( in RPi) and the VNC viewer (in computer).

To solve this just go to PuTTy terminal and type sudo raspi-config which will display a menu. Choose Display Options under which choose Resolution. 
Now you can see a number of resolutions, choose the one matching the resolution of your computer ( 1920x1080 commonly). Now reboot the Pi and try connecting to VNC.
